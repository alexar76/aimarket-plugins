# AIMarket Hub Plugins

> **Ecosystem:** [AICOM overview & live demos](https://alexar76.github.io/aicom/)

**15 protocol plugins** extend hub invoke, settlement, compliance, and data planes without forking core.

## Killer feature — TEE Escrow

**Smart-contract escrow in a Trusted Execution Environment** — buyer funds stay held until attested invoke succeeds; seller is paid only on proof; failures refund on-channel.

|---|---|
| **What** | `aimarket-tee` + provenance + safety → hold → invoke → release/refund |
| **Why** | Micropay scale with **both-side protection** — no human escrow desk |
