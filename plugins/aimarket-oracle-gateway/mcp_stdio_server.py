"""Stdio MCP server for Glama / Claude Desktop — AIMarket Oracle Gateway.

Exposes the ecosystem's oracle capabilities as MCP tools so any AI agent can discover and
consume them, **pay-per-call over the AIMarket protocol, with no signup**:

  • verifiable randomness (Platon) — Ed25519-signed, unbiasable, with a proof you can verify;
  • a verifiable delay function (Chronos) — proof that real sequential work (≈ elapsed time) ran;
  • reputation scoring (LUMEN) — PageRank/EigenTrust over a directed trust graph you supply.

Every tool returns the same envelope (JSON string):
    {
      "capability_id": "<id>@v1",
      "result":        { …the oracle's verifiable output… },
      "price_usd":     <float, authoritative price charged>,
      "routing_fee_usd": <float, the slice that funds the ecosystem>,
      "source":        "hub" | "oracle-direct",
      "verifiable":    { "signed": <bool>, "has_proof": <bool> }
    }

Configure with environment variables:
    AIMARKET_HUB_URL        AIMarket Hub base URL — recommended (metered + paid; routing fee
                            funds the ecosystem). e.g. https://modelmarket.dev
    AIMARKET_ORACLE_URL     direct oracle-family URL — demo/free path used if no hub is set.
    AIMARKET_PAYMENT_CHANNEL  optional pre-opened payment-channel id (sent as X-Payment-Channel).
    AIMARKET_API_TOKEN      optional bearer token (dev/prod auth).
If neither URL is set, every tool fails closed with a clear message — it never fakes a result.
